Descriptive Statistics

Mean: The average of a dataset, sum of values divided by the number of values.

Median: The middle value when data is arranged in order.

Mode: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.

Range: Difference between the maximum and minimum values.

Variance: Measure of how data points deviate from the mean.

Standard Deviation: The square root of variance; measures spread of data.

Quartiles: Values that divide the dataset into four equal parts.

Interquartile Range (IQR): Difference between the 3rd and 1st quartiles.

Skewness: Measure of asymmetry in a data distribution.

Kurtosis: Measure of the "tailedness" of a data distribution.

Probability & Distributions

Probability Distribution: Function that assigns probabilities to possible outcomes.

Binomial Distribution: Probability distribution of successes in fixed trials.

Poisson Distribution: Models the number of events in a fixed interval.

Normal Distribution: Symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution of continuous data.

Uniform Distribution: All outcomes have equal probability.

Exponential Distribution: Models the time between events in a Poisson process.

Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): Probability that a variable is less than or equal to a value.

Probability Mass Function (PMF): Probability function for discrete variables.

Probability Density Function (PDF): Probability function for continuous variables.

Central Limit Theorem: Distribution of sample means approaches normal as sample size increases.

Inferential Statistics

Hypothesis Testing: Testing assumptions about a population parameter.

Null Hypothesis (H0): The default assumption that there is no effect or difference.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The assumption that there is an effect or difference.

p-value: Probability of observing the data if H0 is true.

Confidence Interval: Range of values likely to contain a population parameter.

t-Test: Compares means between two groups.

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Compares means across three or more groups.

Chi-Square Test: Tests relationship between categorical variables.

Correlation Analysis: Measures strength and direction of a linear relationship.

Regression Analysis: Models the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

Advanced & Multivariate Techniques

Multiple Regression: Regression with multiple independent variables.

Logistic Regression: Models binary outcome variables.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces dimensionality of data while preserving variance.

Factor Analysis: Identifies latent variables that explain observed correlations.

Cluster Analysis: Groups data points based on similarity.

Time Series Analysis: Analysis of data points collected over time.

Autoregressive (AR) Models: Time series models that predict future values using past values.

Moving Average (MA) Models: Smooths time series data to identify trends.

Survival Analysis: Analysis of time-to-event data.

Bayesian Statistics: Updates probability estimates using prior knowledge and new data.
